# Algorithmic-Bias

A basic guideline for any newcoming student, the CSULB College of Education website is a vital source. Welcoming the students to the college, this website must convey a sense of hospitality to any who arrives. From previous research (Rodgers, 2022), the visual representation of African American students is at a disappointing 2%. This data attracts the idea that any student from a minority class may not be present at the CSULB. If underrepresented, the minoritized students that want to join CSULB may feel an aversion towards this college. This aversion produces the difficulty of not maintaining a proper display of hospitality.
